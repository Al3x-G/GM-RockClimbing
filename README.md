# About

Greater Manchester Rock Climbing Group is a real group where I volunteer every Sunday. Advertisement for the group has been a mix of [facebook page](#https://www.facebook.com/groups/1530175777232049/) and the [meetup app](#https://www.meetup.com/greater-manchester-rock-climbing/events/vndsltygchbzb/). I wanted to create a single website that links everthing together and is easily accessible.

## User Experience (UX)

### User Requirements

#### Website Owner Goals

- We want the website to attract new members and grab the attention of the user.
- We want the website to be clear, easy to use, not have to much information and clearly show our goal.
- We want all relevant links to existing external websites to be accessible on all pages of the website.
- We want the website to be responsive on all devices.

#### Website Visitor Goals

- I want the site to be easy to navigate, with clear instructions on where to book.
- I want the website to have clear instructions on where and when the group takes place.
- I want to be able to see reviews of existing members.
- I want to be able to see what the group offers.

### Strategy Tradeoffs

#### Strategy Criteria
 - To decide what features the website should have for it's users. I created a [table](#strategy-table) and listed 14 main criteria. Then following UX strategy I came up with a solution on which were most important and which could be traded off.
 - The strategy used was to give each of the criteria a score, the first being importance, how crucial is this for the user? The second being viability/feasibility, how realistic is it that we implement this for the user? 
 - The following table shows the results of this strategy.

#### Strategy Table

#### Strategy Assessment 

- When creating the table, I first tallied the two criteria requirements, then added the totals to calculate the average score. As seen in the table the average was 7.71.
- The next stage was to plot these results in a colour coded strategy graph. Red being the most relevant and green being the least. All criteria that was above the average score can been deemed most relavant to be included in the website.

#### Strategy Graph

#### Strategy Reasons

- The table below documents the reasons why each part of the criteria was used, or not, in the final website. The reason section shows how I judged each criteria to see if it was important and viable/feasible.

| Goal Criteria | Reference | Importance Score | Viability/Feasibility Score | Reason |

| Own Website | B | 5 | 5 | Better consolidation of existing online resources |

| Links to existing sites | G | 4 | 5 | Essential. |
| Reviews | H | 3 | 3 | Good idea but will need to ask existing members in person. |
